# POWER-BI-PROJECTS
These are some of the Power BI dashboards I created using DAX functions, filters, and a variety of visualization tools. I built these projects to turn raw data into clear, useful insights. Along the way, I learned how to spot patterns, build smart data models, and tell stories with data in a way thatâ€™s easy to understand and take action on.
